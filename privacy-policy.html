                    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all who use the website accessible at https://www.bnblaunch.io/ (the "Site"), which is owned and operated by GrowAI, a Delaware limited liability company, and its subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors (collectively, "bnb"). For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the words "you" and "your" refer to each individual accessing and using the Site, and "bnb" may sometimes be referred to herein as "us," "our," or "we." The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what information bnb may collect, how we use such information and who we will share such information with, if at all, when you access and use the Site.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy does not address the privacy practices of any third parties that we do not own, control, or are affiliated with. By accessing or using the Site, you confirm your agreement to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, you may not access or use the Site. This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to the Site with regard to the information that they share and that we collect on the Site. This Privacy Policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than the Site.</p>

                    <p>When you access and use our Site, we collect the information that you choose to provide to us.

                    <p>Like most website operators, we also collect non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our Site. We may also gather certain information automatically, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), operating system, your Site activity (including the Site content you view, mouse movements, mouse clicks, taps, swipes, and information you view), and/or clickstream data for purposes such as analyzing trends, administering the Site, improving the function and content of the Site, and enforcing our Terms of Use. We use standard Internet technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, session replay/screen capture, and similar technologies to collect this information, as explained below in the section on cookies.</p>
                    <p>We may also collect precise information about your location, such as your mobile device's GPS coordinates, cell tower information, and/or Wi-Fi signals. We may use this information to personalize your experience in connection with your use of the Site. If you do not want bnb to collect and use your specific geolocation information, you can disable the location features on your device. Check your device manufacturer settings for how to do so.</p>

We also impose restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. We have summarized how we share the information we collect below.</p>
                    <p>If you have purchased a business opportunity from bnb, we may share your personal contact information with prospective customers, which is limited to your first name, first letter of your last name, phone number, and your state of residence. A prospective customer may contact you to compare your experience with what bnb told you about its business opportunity.</p>
                    <p>We may share your information with our affiliates (companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with bnb) as well as select partners. Examples of how these entities may use your information include making predictions about your interests and providing you with special offers, promotions, advertisements, and other materials.</p>
