# Mobile Optimization Guide

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Logo Not Appearing in Mobile Navigation
- **Problem**: Logo was using `content: url()` which doesn't work reliably
- **Solution**: Changed to proper `display: block` with `width: auto` and `height` sizing
- **Result**: Logo now displays correctly on all mobile devices

### ✅ 2. Mobile Page Width Issues
- **Problem**: Page was wider than viewport, causing horizontal scrolling
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive width constraints:
  - `max-width: 100vw` on html, body
  - `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scroll
  - Proper container max-widths
  - Fixed navigation menu width constraints

### ✅ 3. Hamburger Menu Navigation Bugs
- **Problem**: Menu links weren't working properly, menu wasn't closing correctly
- **Solution**: Improved JavaScript:
  - Added proper event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
  - Added delay for internal navigation to allow page transitions
  - Added click-outside-to-close functionality
  - Improved mobile menu styling with proper width constraints
