                    <p>If your Program includes software access, you receive a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use Arbitrage OS during your active subscription strictly for your internal business purposes and, where expressly permitted by your plan, to deploy limited downstream, end-client usage as part of services you deliver to your customers.</p>

                    <p>Unless otherwise stated at checkout, access to coaching, community, and curriculum is provided for a minimum commitment of twelve (12) months ("Initial Term"). Certain course content may remain available thereafter at our discretion; live/coaching benefits do not.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.2 Subscription Renewal</h3>
                    <p>Where a subscription applies (monthly/annual), it auto-renews for successive periods at the then-current rate unless cancelled at least seven (7) days before renewal in your account portal or via written notice to team@growaiagency.io.</p>

                    <h3>4.1 Fees</h3>
                    <p>You agree to pay all fees indicated at checkout or in your order form. All amounts are in U.S. Dollars and exclusive of taxes, which you must pay where applicable.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4.2 Payment Plans</h3>

                    <h3>4.4 Late Fees; Interest; Collections</h3>
                    <p>Past-due amounts may accrue interest at 1.5% per month (18% APR) or the maximum allowed by law, plus reasonable collection costs and attorneys' fees. We may accelerate the remaining balance of any plan upon default.</p>

                    <h3>4.6 Chargebacks are Breach</h3>
                    <p>Initiating a chargeback without first emailing team@growaiagency.io and allowing five (5) business days to resolve is a material breach. If a chargeback is reversed in our favor, you agree to reimburse direct scheme fees ($25 per incident) plus an administrative fee of $250.</p>

                    <p>If your plan explicitly includes end-client enablement, you may use Company IP only as embedded within your services delivered to your end clients, not as standalone resalable IP or software, and not to create competing courses, toolkits, or platforms. You must ensure your clients cannot access or extract our underlying materials or code except via your service deliverables.</p>

                    <p>During your Program and for six (6) months thereafter, you will not market or sell a paid course, program, or platform that teaches others how to build and sell AI arbitrage agencies in material competition with Grow AI's core offer. This does not restrict general marketing consulting or your use of AI in client work.</p>
                    
                    <h3>8.2 Non-Solicit</h3>

                    <p>ALL SALES ARE FINAL. No refunds, credits, or exchanges are provided except as expressly set forth in Section 11.2 or required by law.</p>

                    <p>If you do not acquire a first paying client within ninety (90) days of purchase, you may request a refund minus a $500 processing fee, provided you strictly satisfy all requirements below (the "Guarantee Requirements"):</p>
                    <p>(a) Curriculum Completion: Complete 100% of the core course within fourteen (14) days of purchase (as recorded in our LMS).</p>
                    <p>(b) Daily Action Log ("Top 1"). Post a Daily Top 1 action update in the Community every calendar day for the full 90-day period (min. 50 words), describing the single highest-impact action you personally performed to acquire clients. Missing more than three (3) days total voids the guarantee.</p>
                    <p>(c) Coaching Attendance: Attend all weekly live coaching calls during the 90-day period; watching replays does not count.</p>
                    <p>(d) Prospecting Activity: Maintain verifiable outreach consistent with Program guidance (e.g., cold email/DM/meetings logged). Upon request, provide timestamped records (spreadsheets or CRM exports) evidencing prospect lists, sent messages, replies, bookings, and follow-ups.</p>
                    <p>(e) Refund Consultation: Schedule and attend a refund consultation call with our designated representative within the 90-day period.</p>
                    
                    <h3>11.3 Guarantee Limitations</h3>
                    <p>The guarantee is void if you (i) breach this Agreement; (ii) fail any single requirement in 11.2; (iii) behave disruptively in the Community; (iv) request after day 90; or (v) secured $5,000+ contracted revenue attributable to Program methods within the 90-day period.</p>
                    
                    <h3>11.4 Final Determination</h3>
